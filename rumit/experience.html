			<h2>Working as a waitress at Brodin's Station</h2>
			<p>This is my first work experience and from there i realise how hard to make money and how we should appreciate our parents more.  From here I learn how deal with many attitudes of customers and I really valuable the experience</p>
			<h2>Working as a runner at Pizza Hut G-Orange</h2>
			<p> My work is to greet customers, take orders and setting up the table.  I really enjoy working here becuase it is more professional than my previous work where there is rules that need to be follow since Pizza Hut is a well-known brand.  I am really thankful for the precious experience i got and for the managers who have taught me so much things</p>
			<h2>Working as a baker at Cik Bakes Bakery</h2>
			<p>I know how to bake since I was in Primary School since i really enjoy sweet things.  At this bakery i manage to improve my baking skills and i learned so many recipes</p>
